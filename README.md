# SocialChoiceSimulation

Ignore the ouwe knikkers directory(this was for an initial plan which we didn't go through with).

Inside the eurovision directory there are two important files::
**create_profiles.py:**
This file reads in the eurovision_song_contest_1975_2019.xlsx and converts it to python dictionaries representing the profiles from the different editions of the song contest.
**some_social_choice_functions_notebook.ipynb:**
This file contains notebook file contains the code for social choice functions, the different measures and the experiment we conducted.
